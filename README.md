### What I learned

This is my 2nd time practicing Tailwind so I'm learning how to use it in general e.g. best practices, how to configure extends, etc. Overtime I feel like Tailwind CSS is more useful for bigger projects vs. building small components like this task.

### Continued development

Keep code DRY and make code reusable
